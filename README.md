# Human-Vs-Horse-prediction:
          This is a two class classification problem.Here the contents of the .zip are 
          extracted to the base directory /tmp/horse-or-human, which in turn each contain 
          horses and humans subdirectories.The model consists of several convolutional layers followed
          by MaxPooling.This model predicts with 92% accuracy in less than 6 epochs.
